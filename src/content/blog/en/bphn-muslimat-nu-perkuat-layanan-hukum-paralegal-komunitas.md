  - "The National Law Development Agency (BPHN) of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights has partnered with Muslimat NU to enhance legal services through community-based paralegals. This collaboration aims to improve legal literacy and access to justice at the grassroots level."
  - "The initiative was inaugurated during a public consultation forum focused on developing guidelines for implementing legal aid posts (Posbakum) in villages and sub-districts."
  - "The Head of BPHN's Legal Empowerment and Aid Center emphasized the vital role of community paralegals in bridging the gap between formal legal systems and the public, particularly in underserved areas."
  - "The forum was attended by representatives from legal aid organizations, academia, and other stakeholders who provided input on the draft guidelines. The collaboration is expected to strengthen inter-agency synergy and enhance the effectiveness of legal aid implementation at the village level."
  - "Through this partnership, communities will have easier access to legal information, case consultations, and assistance in drafting legal documents. This is anticipated to increase legal awareness and reduce potential legal conflicts within society."
  - "BPHN also encourages capacity building for village officials to understand the roles and functions of legal aid posts, including through training and technical assistance. With a collaborative approach, BPHN hopes that all community layers can experience the tangible benefits of accessible legal services in their areas."
