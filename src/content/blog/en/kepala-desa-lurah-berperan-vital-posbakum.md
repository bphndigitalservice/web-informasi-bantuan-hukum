  "The Head of the Center for Legal Education and Aid (Kapusbudbankum) at the National Legal Development Agency (BPHN), Ministry of Law, stated that village heads and sub-district chiefs play a vital role in strengthening the Legal Aid Post (Posbakum) scheme. This statement was made during a public consultation forum on drafting implementation guidelines for Posbakum in villages and sub-districts.",
  "Kapusbudbankum emphasized that Posbakum is a tangible manifestation of the government's commitment to providing access to justice for the community, especially at the grassroots level. In this scheme, village heads and sub-district chiefs not only act as facilitators but also as key actors in building a participatory legal culture.",
  "The public consultation forum was attended by various representatives from legal aid organizations, academics, and other stakeholders who provided input on the draft guidelines. Kapusbudbankum added that the drafting of these guidelines will strengthen inter-agency synergy and enhance the effectiveness of legal aid implementation at the village level.",
  "With the establishment of Posbakum in villages and sub-districts, the community can easily access legal information services, case consultations, and assistance in drafting legal documents. This is expected to increase legal awareness and reduce potential legal conflicts within the community.",
  "BPHN also encourages the capacity building of village officials in understanding the roles and functions of Posbakum, including through training and technical assistance. Through a collaborative approach, BPHN hopes that all layers of society can experience the tangible benefits of legal aid services in their areas."
